  abstract = {This paper presents results from a comparative analysis of environmental income from approximately 8000 households in 24 developing countries collected by research partners in CIFOR’s Poverty Environment Network (PEN). Environmental income accounts for 28\% of total household income, 77\% of which comes from natural forests. Environmental income shares are higher for low-income households, but differences across income quintiles are less pronounced than previously thought. The poor rely more heavily on subsistence products such as wood fuels and wild foods, and on products harvested from natural areas other than forests. In absolute terms environmental income is approximately five times higher in the highest income quintile, compared to the two lowest quintiles.},

  abstract = {The world's forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.},

Established methods for measuring carbon in forests exist, and are best based on permanent sample plots laid out in a statistically sound design. Measurements on trees in these plots can be readily converted to aboveground biomass using either biomass expansion factors or allometric regression equations. A compilation of existing root biomass data for upland forests of the world generated a significant regression equation that can be used to predict root biomass based on aboveground biomass only. Methods for measuring coarse dead wood have been tested in many forest types, but the methods could be improved if a non-destructive tool for measuring the density of dead wood was developed. Future measurements of carbon storage in forests may rely more on remote sensing data, and new remote data collection technologies are in development. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using a maximum likelihood supervised classification of satellite images from 1990 to 2016, coupled with field and a socio-economic survey, we performed a robust land-use classification. Between 1990 and 2016, the area included eight classes of land use, with the largest in 1990 being the woody savannah (42.9\%) followed by the gallery forest (20.2\%) and the clear forest (16.3\%). Between 1990 and 1999, the gallery forest lost 64.8\% of its area mostly to the benefit of woody savannahs. Between 1999 and 2016, the largest loss of area was that of the clear forest, which decreased generally by 43.2\% in favor of woody savannah. Rates of increase of crop field areas were 59.6\% and 78.8\% respectively for the periods of 1990 to 1999 and 1999 to 2016 to the detriment of woody savannahs. We attribute the changes in land use observed mainly to the increasing human population and associated agriculture, overgrazing, fuelwood harvesting and bush fires. The exploitation of non-timber forest products and climatic factors may also have changed the vegetation cover. We recommend the implementation of farming techniques with low impact on the environment such as agroforestry.},

National REDD+ initiatives have made prog- ress toward creating domestic conditions for addressing deforestation and forest degrada- tion, including better understanding of de- forestation drivers, higher forest-monitoring capacities, and increased stakeholder engage- ment. However, these advancements have not yet turned the tide on deforestation. For the most part, new coalitions calling for change in forest governance have failed to overcome business-as-usual deforesta- tion. Subnational REDD+ initiatives have generated important insights into the agents and driv- ers of deforestation that must be addressed at higher levels (e.g., tenure, nance, globally traded commodities), along with the complex- ity of multilevel governance structures that are needed to implement carbon accounting, safeguards, and incentive systems.}

We examine how much climate mitigation nature can contribute to this goal with a comprehensive analysis of “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and/or improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We show that NCS can provide over one-third of the cost-effective climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to stabilize warming to below 2 °C. Alongside aggressive fossil fuel emissions reductions, NCS offer a powerful set of options for nations to deliver on the Paris Climate Agreement while improving soil productivity, cleaning our air and water, and maintaining biodiversity.           ,                             Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams of CO               2               equivalent (PgCO               2               e) y               −1               (95\% CI 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO               2               e y               −1               ) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO               2               pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO               2               e               −1               by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective CO               2               mitigation needed through 2030 for a {$>$}66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO               2               −1               . Most NCS actions—if effectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

Climate-driven vegetation models typically predict that this tropical forest ‘carbon sink’ will continue for decades4,5. Here we assess trends in the carbon sink using 244 structurally intact African tropical forests spanning 11 countries, compare them with 321 published plots from Amazonia and investigate the underlying drivers of the trends. The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.53–0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline in Amazonian forests6. Therefore the carbon sink responses of Earth’s two largest expanses of tropical forest have diverged. The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with no detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and air temperature7,8,9. Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our most intensively monitored plots suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including carbon dioxide, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the African sink, whereas the Amazonian sink continues to weaken rapidly. Overall, the uptake of carbon into Earth’s intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s. Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing in size, independent observations indicating greater recent carbon uptake into the Northern Hemisphere landmass10 reinforce our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already peaked. This saturation and ongoing decline of the tropical forest carbon sink has consequences for policies intended to stabilize Earth’s climate.}

Establishing past rates of climate change from temperature proxy data remains difficult given their limited spatiotemporal resolution. In contrast, past greenhouse gas radiative forcing, causing climate to change, is well known from ice cores. We compare rates of change of anthropogenic forcing with rates of natural greenhouse gas forcing since the Last Glacial Maximum and of solar and volcanic forcing of the last millennium. The smoothing of atmospheric variations by the enclosure process of air into ice is computed with a firn diffusion and enclosure model. The 20th century increase in CO               2               and its radiative forcing occurred more than an order of magnitude faster than any sustained change during the past 22,000 years. The average rate of increase in the radiative forcing not just from CO               2               but from the combination of CO               2               , CH               4               , and N               2               O is larger during the Industrial Era than during any comparable period of at least the past 16,000 years. In addition, the decadal-to-century scale rate of change in anthropogenic forcing is unusually high in the context of the natural forcing variations (solar and volcanoes) of the past millennium. Our analysis implies that global climate change, which is anthropogenic in origin, is progressing at a speed that is unprecedented at least during the last 22,000 years.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use and land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ . For the last decade available (2008–2017), EFF was 9.4 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, ELUC 1.5 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, GATM 4.7 ± 0.02 GtC yr−1, SOCEAN 2.4 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, and SLAND 3.2 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.5 GtC yr−1 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2017 alone, the growth in EFF was about 1.6 \% and emissions increased to 9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1. Also for 2017, ELUC was 1.4 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, GATM was 4.6 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1, SOCEAN was 2.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 3.8 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of 0.3 GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 405.0 ± 0.1 ppm averaged over 2017. For 2018, preliminary data for the first 6–9 months indicate a renewed growth in EFF of +2.7 \% (range of 1.8 \% to 3.7 \%) based on national emission projections for China, the US, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. The analysis presented here shows that the mean and trend in the five components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period of 1959–2017, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations show (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions, (2) a persistent low agreement among the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the CO2 variability by ocean models, originating outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Quéré et al., 2018, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013).

  abstract = {This paper presents a map of Africa's rainforests for 2005. Derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data at a spatial resolution of 250 m and with an overall accuracy of 84\%, this map provides new levels of spatial and thematic detail. The map is accompanied by measurements of deforestation between 1990, 2000 and 2010 for West Africa, Central Africa and Madagascar derived from a systematic sample of Landsat images—imagery from equivalent platforms is used to fill gaps in the Landsat record. Net deforestation is estimated at 0.28\% yr               −1               for the period 1990–2000 and 0.14\% yr               −1               for the period 2000–2010. West Africa and Madagascar exhibit a much higher deforestation rate than the Congo Basin, for example, three times higher for West Africa and nine times higher for Madagascar. Analysis of variance over the Congo Basin is then used to show that expanding agriculture and increasing fuelwood demands are key drivers of deforestation in the region, whereas well-controlled timber exploitation programmes have little or no direct influence on forest-cover reduction at present. Rural and urban population concentrations and fluxes are also identified as strong underlying causes of deforestation in this study.},

  abstract = {Governance and Participation in the Mangement of Forest Ressources in Cameroon and Its Unforeseen Impacts on Land Use Practices.The protection of forests is not a new preoccupation in African countries. There already existed a homogeneous forest legislation for the African countries under French domination since 1935. However, attention was given to the regulation of the utilitarian aspects of forest management without taking into account the stakes of a sustainable management of the environment. The exploitation of wood and the control of extraction quotas were the main concerns, but not the environment. After having attained independence and having become sovereign states, the former colonies opted for the continuation of the colonial legislation. As the states grew more mature, their legislation began to show a clear trend towards more ecological concerns. But the weakness of the regulatory frame could not cope with the rapid increase of resource extraction and other human activities such as agriculture and hunting, which led to an accelerated decline in forests. Until the Rio Conference in 1992, the model of management remained heavily influenced by that of the forestry State (‘Etat forestier’): it was based on the State's monopoly to manage the resource, with all the prerogatives involving the distribution of exploitation rights and of tax collection that this entails. In this system, populations living in the zones where the resources are extracted did not benefit from the fruits of this very profitable forest exploitation. Besides being marginalized, they were also required to obtain special authorization from the administration in order to have a restricted access to the resource. Analysts agreed that such exclusion bears a risk for the concerned resource. As professor De la Mettrie noted in an analysis on forest and agronomy policies in 1990: “An estate that is appropriated by the State with no respect paid to procedures of customary allocation, with no real approval of the populations and with no benefit for them, becomes ecologically endangered.” What holds true for an estate (‘terrain’) is all the more true for the resource it sustains. This conviction was shared by the administration of Cameroon. In the introduction to Cameroon’s official document on forest policy of 1995, it is explicitly recognized that the populations who are excluded from the management and the sharing of the benefits that arise from the exploitation of the resources they have actively helped to preserve cease to feel concerned by the protection of these resources. The programme of political action is therefore oriented towards the following objective: “to perpetuate and develop the economic, ecological and social functions of forests in the frame of an integrated and participative management that ensures the conservation and the utilization of the resources and of the forest ecosystems in a sustainable way.” Through pressure exercised by NGOs and those providing funds, and with the help of international cooperation, governments implemented new regulations and modern tools of control and of management. Today, many programmes and projects funded by international cooperation require the increased participation of civil society. Thus, on the ground, the exploitation of the forests, which represents a significant budgetary reserve, was to be continued with the objective of seeking to establish an equilibrium between exploitation and regeneration, as well as the participation of the local populations in the benefits of growth. It was only in 1994 that Cameroon initiated an ambitious programme of reform of its forest policy and of the sustainable management of renewable forest resources. This reform has produced real tools promoting participative management: the promotion of social forestry through the creation of a new category of forests, viz. community forests, and of spaces, viz. community hunting spaces. These two new institutions are open to exploitation by the local populations for their own benefit with a less burdensome procedure. The sharing of certain forest tax revenues among the State, decentralized collectivities (communes) and the populations living in the areas where the activities of forest exploitation are carried out has been institutionalized. But these reforms do not bring the expected results, for endogenous as well as exogenous reasons. The present article presents the changes that can be observed in the management practices of farmland and natural resources (pratiques foncières). It suggests that these practices be considered as popular modes of political action. Populations seem to use the management of land and natural resources as a tool for passive resistance against a new order each time the latter fails to represent their interests in an adequate way. At the local level, the aim of this research is to assess the real impacts of forest and environmental policies on the farming communities. It looks at the social as well as at the environmental impact, approaching the management of land and natural resources as an implicit social fact through which it is possible to understand the games the actors play. The stake is to reconcile the conservation of vital spaces for biodiversity with the frequently conflicting and vital interests of the local communities in these spaces for their survival.},

  abstract = {This study assesses land cover change of the Koupa Matapit forest gallery, West Cameroon, in relation to anthropogenic factors. Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted to investigate the relationships between the local population and the gallery forest; the spatio-temporal dynamics of the landscapes around the gallery forest were studied from the diachronic analysis of three Landsat TM satellite images of 1984, Landsat ETM + 1999 and Landsat OLI\_TIRS of 2016, supplemented by verification missions on field. The satellite images were processed using ArcGIS and Erdas Imagine software. According to surveys, it should be noted that agriculture and livestock are the main economic activities of the population of Koupa Matapit, agriculture and fuel wood collection for energy were the main anthropogenic activities responsible for deforestation and degradation of the forest gallery. The collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) would have a significant implication in land use and cover changes. The results indicate that the extension of savannah/agricultural land (from 6989 ha in 1984 to 7604 ha in 2016) and bare soil/built up area (from 71 ha in 1984 to 342 ha in 2016) would have led to the disappearance of much of the forest area (1465 ha in 1984 to 580 ha in 2016). The rapid population growth of Koupa Matapit would be responsible for these pressures. There is an urgent need to implement appropriate land use policy in this area.},

The harvest of animals such as tapir, duikers, deer, pigs, peccaries, primates and larger rodents, birds and reptiles provides benefits to local people worth millions of US\$ annually and represents around 6 million tonnes of animals extracted yearly. Vulnerability to hunting varies, with some species sustaining populations in heavily hunted secondary habitats, while others require intact forests with minimal harvesting to maintain healthy populations. Some species or groups have been characterized as ecosystem engineers and ecological keystone species. They affect plant distribution and structure ecosystems, through seed dispersal and predation, grazing, browsing, rooting and other mechanisms. Global attention has been drawn to their loss through debates regarding bushmeat, the “empty forest” syndrome and their ecological importance. However, information on the harvest remains fragmentary, along with understanding of ecological, socioeconomic and cultural dimensions. Here we assess the consequences, both for ecosystems and local livelihoods, of the loss of these species in the Amazon and Congo basins.},

The Caimpugan peatland in Agusan del Sur was considered the ‘undisturbed’ site, while the Bambanin peatland in Mindoro Oriental was the ‘disturbed’ site. The aboveground biomass at the undisturbed site was 35.8 ± 30.0 Mg ha−1) while at the disturbed site, it was 2.0 Mg ha−1 ± 1.9 Mg ha−1. The aboveground C content at the undisturbed site varied from 1.29 Mg C ha−1 to 37.2 Mg C ha−1, while the disturbed site only ranged from 0.1 Mg C ha−1 to 2.1 Mg C ha−1. A trend of increasing soil carbon content as the soil gets deeper was observed in both sites. At the undisturbed site, the average soil carbon content was 750 ± 710 Mg ha−1 and 595 ± 406 Mg ha−1 at the disturbed site. In terms of soil carbon emission, the undisturbed site had 3.6 ± 3.0 g C m−2d−1 and was only one-third the emission rate at the disturbed site (11.2 ± 6.4 g C m−2d−1). Our study highlights the dire condition of a disturbed peatland in terms of vegetation/soil carbon dynamics. We underscored the need to address the pressing issues on peatland drainage, agricultural activities, and human settlement within the peatland sites geared towards effectively managing this important carbon reservoir in the Philippines.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests contribute to climate change mitigation by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and storing this in biomass and soil organic matter. However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the above- and belowground quantity and distribution of carbon stocks in African forests. Here, we evaluate how different carbon pools (aboveground live biomass, aboveground dead biomass, belowground biomass) contribute to total carbon stocks, and how different carbon components (e.g. large trees, understorey trees, coarse woody debris, roots, soil organic carbon etc.) contribute to carbon pools and total carbon stocks. We evaluated data of extensive inventories within 30 1-ha plots spanning the terra-firme semi-deciduous forest in eastern Cameroon. Hence, the plots were placed at a mean distance of 1~km from the nearest plot and we analyzed the data using variation partitioning, linear regressions and correlation tests. We found that the terra-firme semi-deciduous forests store 283.97~±~51.42~Mg~C~ha−1. The aboveground biomass pool, with a carbon stock of 180.99~±~25.8~Mg~C~ha−1, mostly explained variation in total carbon stocks (R2~=~0.79). From all aboveground biomass components, carbon in large trees was most strongly correlated with total carbon stocks. The second most important carbon pool was belowground carbon (on average 85.06~±~16.86~Mg~C~ha−1; R2~=~0.78), mainly explained by coarse root carbon. Carbon in dead biomass had only a small contribution to total carbon stocks (R2~=~0.04). Hence, our results indicate that aboveground live biomass is a good predictor for variation in total carbon storage within this semi-deciduous terra-firme forest. However, aboveground live carbon and belowground carbon and their interactions explained most of the variation in total carbon stock, indicating that a whole-ecosystem approach is necessary for a full understanding of the carbon cycle.}
